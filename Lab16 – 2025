Multitasking Playbook 
============================================================================================
Write an Ansible playbook named multitask1.yml that automates user, group, file, package, service, and firewall configurations on all managed nodes.

Tasks:
1. Create a User
    o	Use the user module to create a user named sandy.
    o	Ensure the user is present on all managed nodes.
2. Create a Group
    o	Use the group module to create a group named developers.
    o	Ensure the group exists on all nodes.
    o	Trigger a handler named “add user to group” when this task runs.
3. Create a File
    o	Use the file module to create an empty file named my-new-file in /tmp.
    o	Set state: touch so it creates the file if it does not exist.
    o	Trigger a handler named “copy file in home dir” when this task runs.
4.  Install a Package
    o	Use the yum module to install the httpd package.
    o	Ensure the package is installed on all nodes.
    o	Trigger two handlers after installation:
        -	start service
        -	add service in firewall
5.	Define Handlers
    o	Create handlers to perform actions after tasks trigger them:
      1. add user to group
          -	Use the user module to add sandy to the developers group.
          -	Use append: yes to avoid removing other group memberships.
      2. copy file in home dir
          -	Use the copy module to copy the file /tmp/my-new-file to /home/sandy/my-new-file.
      3. start service
          -	Use the systemd module to start and enable the httpd service.
      4. add service in firewall
          -	Use the firewalld module to enable the http service in the firewall permanently and immediately.

Expected Outcome:
=================
After running the playbook:
  •	User sandy and group developers should exist.
  •	User sandy should be a member of developers.
  •	The file /home/sandy/my-new-file should exist and be copied from /tmp.
  •	The httpd service should be installed, started, and enabled on boot.
  •	The HTTP rule should be enabled in the system firewall.
