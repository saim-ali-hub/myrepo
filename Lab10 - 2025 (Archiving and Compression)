Tar Command Practice – Archiving and Compression
=====================================================================================
Prerequisite:
Ensure your current working directory (PWD) is your home directory and you are operating as a regular (non-root) user.

1. The /etc directory contains many important configuration files and subdirectories. Create an uncompressed archive of /etc in your current working directory, naming it etc_backup.tar. Use the tar command with verbose output enabled. (Do not compress this file.)

2. Verify the size of etc_backup.tar using either:
   o	ls -lh
   o	du -sh

3. In your home directory, create a new directory named tar_practice and navigate to this directory.

4. Create another backup of /etc in tar_practice directory, but this time archive and compress it simultaneously, naming it etc_backup.tar.gz.

5. Compare the sizes of ~/etc_backup.tar and etc_backup.tar.gz using:
   o ls –lh
   o du –sh
   Note: Archiving alone does not reduce file size, but compression does.Thanks to the tar command’s compression options.

6. Execute command cd and check you PWD should be your home directory. List the contents of etc_backup.tar without extracting it.

7. Now extract etc_backup.tar into your current working directory.

8. Navigate into tar_practice, and extract etc_backup.tar.gz which is already in this directory.

9. Return to your home directory, create a directory named new_tarball_dir, navigate into it, and create an uncompressed archive named new_backup.tar containing both /etc/passwd and /etc/group. (You can archive multiple files at once.)

10. List the contents of new_backup.tar without extracting.

11. While inside new_tarball_dir, append the files /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts to the existing new_backup.tar archive.

12. Again List all files contained in new_backup.tar. Wow! files are appended in it. 

13. Instead of listing all files, check if /etc/group exists within new_backup.tar.

14. Verify whether new_backup.tar is a compressed or uncompressed file.

15. Using an appropriate command validate if tar_practice/etc_backup.tar.gz is compressed file.
