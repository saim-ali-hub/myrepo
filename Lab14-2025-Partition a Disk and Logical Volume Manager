Partition a Disk and Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
=====================================================================================
1. Attach a 1 GB disk as /dev/sdb to your VM and partition it into four parts:
    • The first three partitions should each be 250 MiB.
    • The fourth partition should occupy the remaining space.

2. Format the first partition /dev/sdb1 with the XFS filesystem and mount it at /app1. Ensure the mount is persistent across reboots.

3. Create a volume group named vg-app2 using /dev/sdb2 and /dev/sdb3 as physical volumes. Within this VG, create a 200 MiB logical volume named lv-app2, format it with the EXT4 filesystem, and mount it at /app2.

4. Extend the logical volume lv-app2 by an additional 200 MiB.

5. Further extend lv-app2 to consume all remaining free space in the vg-app2 volume group.

6. Using the fourth partition /dev/sdb4, create a new volume group vg-db. Inside it, create a 200 MiB logical volume named lv-db, format it with the XFS filesystem, and mount it at /database. Ensure this mount is also boot persistent.
