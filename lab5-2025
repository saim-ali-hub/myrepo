PERMISSIONS
=====================================================================================
Note: Please check your present working directory (PWD) — it should be your home directory, and you should remain there throughout the exercise.

1. Create a directory named my_own_dir and check its permissions using the command: ls -ld my_own_dir

2. Change the permissions of the “my_own_dir” directory so that the user can only read and write, while the group and others can read only. Make sure you're using symbolic notation. Then, verify the permissions.

3. Execute the command:
   ls my_own_dir
   Looks like the command ran successfully. Aha! No errors — well done!

4. Try to change into the “my_own_dir” directory. What happened? Did it fail? It should.

5. Now try to create a directory named “Redhat” inside “my_own_dir” while you are still in your home directory. What happened? Did it fail? It should have.

6. Modify the permissions on the “my_own_dir” directory to ensure the user can read, write, and execute; the group can read and write; and others can read only. Now, try creating two directories named “Redhat” and “OEL” inside “my_own_dir”. What happened? This time, it should succeed.

7. After creating the directories above, change the permissions on “my_own_dir” and all files and directories inside it (in a single command) so that the user can read, write, and execute; the group can read and write; and others can read only. (Use numeric notation.)

8. 8.	Change into the “my_own_dir” directory and create a file named “file_1.txt” with content “I love Linux” and also create a directory named dir_1 inside it.

9. Remove read permission from the user, group, and others for the file named “file_1.txt”.

10. Now try to read the file using the cat command. Did it fail? No worries — that was expected.

11. Reassign read permissions to all, and run the cat command again. Were you able to read it? Wow, great!

12. Remove write permission from the user and group for the file “file_1.txt”.

13. Try running this command:
    echo "File permission setting is a fun" > file_1.txt
    It should fail. Did it?

14. Now reassign write permissions to the user and group for the file file_1.txt.

15. Try the same command again:
    echo "File permission setting is a fun" > file_1.txt
    It should succeed this time. Did it?

16. Give execute permission to the owner of “file_1.txt”. (Please use symbolic notation.)

17. Set permissions on the “dir_1” directory using the command line. For example, remove read permission for the owner and execute permission for the group and others.

18. Check the permissions on “dir_1”, redirect the output to a file named “new_info”, and store it under the “~/my_own_dir/Redhat” directory.

19. While inside “my_own_dir”, copy the “new_info” file into the “OEL” directory.

20. Using numeric notation, give full permissions to everyone on the “dir_1” directory.

21. While still in “my_own_dir”, copy the “new_info” file from the OEL directory and rename it to “new_info.txt”. Keep the new file in the “OEL” directory.
