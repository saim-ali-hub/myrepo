==> System Exploration and Basic Info (Tasks 1–5)

The first 10 tasks are just for your revision of command don’t worry just execute command store information in a file “my_server_info”. 

1. display the hostname of your system using both “hostname” and “hostnamectl”.

2. Show the system architecture and kernel version using “uname”.

3. Display how long the system has been running using “uptime”.

4. Show CPU information using “lscpu”.

5. List the block devices connected to the system using “lsblk”.

==> Hands on: System Identification and Basic Info (Tasks 1–16)

1. Create a file named alpha.log with no content in “~/lab2025”.

2. Create a directory structure “~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps” using a single command.

3. Inside the ~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps directory, create three text files with the following content:

   "one.txt" – containing the text "This is my first .txt file"

   "two.txt" – containing the text "This is my second .txt file"

   "three.txt" – containing the text "This is my third .txt file"

4. Create an empty directory named “old_stuff” inside “~/lab2025/Linux” directory and copy all .txt files from “~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps” to “old_stuff” and name is “summary.txt”. 
   (Note: This will result in only one file, summary.txt, containing the last copied file's content — others will be overwritten unless handled differently.)

5. Copy  summary.txt file from “oldstuff” back to “~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps” and rename it “final_three.txt”.

6. Append the long list output of “~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps” into a file named “dirlist.txt” and store in “~/lab2025/Linux”.

7. Create a file using echo named “~/lab2025/Linux/data.csv” with the following comma-separated content:
   id,name,score  on the first line, and 
   1,Alice,85    2,Bob,90   3,Carol,70 on the next three consecutive lines.

8. Use cat to concatenate “summary.txt” and “dirlist.txt” into a new file called ~/lab2025/Linux/merged.log.

9. Use grep to find scores of Carol and Bob in “data.csv” and append in “~/lab2025/Linux/merged.log”.

10. Use grep to find all lines in “data.csv” containing scores above “80” and append in “~/lab2025/Linux/merged.log”.

11. Change directory to “~/lab2025/Linux/DevOps”, create a file “secret.txt” and change its permissions so only the owner and group can read, write and others have no access.

12. Check your PWD make sure you in DevOps directory create a directory “private_dir” and set permissions so only the owner can access it.

13. Change the permissions of “summary.txt” to 640 and verify using ls -l.

14. Give read, write, and execute permissions to the group and others for “data.csv”.

15. Change ownership of “final_three.txt” to another “new-user” and group “admins” on your system using chown.

16. Edit “data.csv” in vim and:
    • Add a new entry: 4,David,95
