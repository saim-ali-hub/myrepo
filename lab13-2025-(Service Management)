Service Management
=====================================================================================
1. Open your terminal and list all unit files. (Hint: use the systemctl command)

2. Narrow down the output to show only service unit files. (Press q to quit when done)

3. List only the enabled services. (Do not use grep)

4. From the listed enabled services, grep the sshd service.

5. From the same enabled list, grep both chronyd and sshd services together.

6. List all disabled services.
7. List all running services.
   Cool!!!! You should now have seen three service states: enabled, disabled, and running.

8. Install the following packages: openssh, chrony, httpd.

9. Start the following services: sshd, chronyd, httpd.

10. Check the status of sshd, chronyd, and httpd. Note the PID of httpd.

11.	Disable the httpd service so it does not start at boot. Check its status and confirm the PID does not change.

12. Enable the httpd service so it starts at boot. Check its status and confirm the PID does not change.

13. Stop the httpd service and check its status. It should be inactive (dead), and no PID will be shown.

14. Start the httpd service again and check its status. The PID should now be present and different from the one in the earlier step.

15. Restart the httpd service and confirm the PID has changed again. (Restart assigns a new PID)

16. Reload the httpd service and confirm the PID remains the same as before.

17. Add custom content to the default web page:
    echo "I am learning Linux service management" >> /var/www/html/index.html

18. Open a browser and visit http://<ip_address_of_machine> to view the content.

19. List the configuration files of the httpd package using:  rpm -qc httpd

20. Open /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf in vim and change the listening port from 80 to 9090 by adding:
    Listen 9090

21. Restart the httpd service. You should see an error because of permission issues.
    Job for httpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status httpd.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

22. Check details with: systemctl status httpd.service
    The error will show permission denied for port 9090.

23. Set SELinux to permissive mode:
    setenforce 0

24. Restart the httpd service again — this time it should work.

25. Test access with curl:
    curl <ip_address_of_machine>:9090

26. Open a browser and test http://<ip_address_of_machine>:9090 — it won’t work yet. It looks like firewall is stopping.

27. Open the firewall port:
    firewall-cmd --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload

28. Test again in the browser — now the website should load successfully.

29. Now let’s explore another important service: Chronyd, which is used for time synchronization. Run the command:
    chronyc sources -v
    This will display the list of available time sources your system is currently using.

30. Next, let’s configure the system to synchronize with our internal time server by following the steps below.
    
    a. Verify chronyd service is active.
    
    b. Edit /etc/chrony.conf and add:
       server 192.168.15.5 iburst

    c. Restart chronyd with:
       systemctl restart chronyd

    d. Check synchronization status:
       chronyc sources -v

       It should confirm the system is syncing with the internal server.

      COOL!!!!!! Enough learning !!!!!!!!!!!!
