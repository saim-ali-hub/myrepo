Linux Filesystem and File Management Lab

1)	Create the following nested directory structure in your home directory: ‘vars/systems/logs’.
2)	Inside the ‘vars/systems’ directory, create an empty file named dmesg.
3)	Create a file named ‘file1.txt’ inside the ‘vars/systems/logs’ directory. The file should contain the text:
"I love Linux and am excited to join the DevOps course".
4)	Now, create another nested directory structure in your home directory: ‘vars/os/configs’.
5)	Copy the ‘/etc/hosts’ file into the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory.
6)	Move the copied hosts file from ‘configs’ into the ‘vars’ directory located in your home directory.
7)	Use the cat command to display the contents of the ‘hosts’ file now located in the ‘vars’ directory.
8)	Again, use cat command to read the same hosts file, but this time redirect its output into a new file called ‘new_hosts’, and store it under the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory.
9)	Copy the ‘file1.txt’ file from the ‘vars/systems/logs’ directory to the ‘vars/os’ directory and rename it to ‘new_file1.txt’ during the copy.
10)	Inside the logs directory, create two empty files named ‘sshd_config’ and ‘httpd.conf’.
11)	Delete the ‘new_hosts’ file located in the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory.
12)	Attempt to delete the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory using the ‘rmdir command’. Were you successful? If not, why do you think it failed?
13)	If the above deletion failed, remove the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory using an appropriate command that can handle non-empty directories.
14)	 Use tail command to display the content of /etc/passwd. How many lines do see in command output?
15)	Now gain use tail command to display the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd.
16)	Use head to show the first 5 lines of /etc/group.
17)	Use more to view a long file like /etc/services. How does navigation work?
18)	Use less instead of more on the same file. What are the advantages of less?
19)	Use the file command on /etc/passwd and /bin/ls. What does it tell you?
