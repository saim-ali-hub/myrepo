1) Create the following nested directory structure in your home directory: ‘vars/systems/logs’.

2) Inside the ‘vars/systems’ directory, create an empty file named dmesg.

3) Create a file named ‘file1.txt’ inside the ‘vars/systems/logs’ directory. The file should contain the text:
   "I love Linux and am excited to join the DevOps course".

4) Now, create another nested directory structure in your home directory: ‘vars/os/configs’.

5) Copy the ‘/etc/hosts’ file into the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory.

6) Copy the copied hosts file from ‘configs’ into the ‘vars’ directory located in your home directory.

7) Use the cat command to display the contents of the ‘hosts’ file now located in the ‘vars’ directory.

8) Again, use cat command to read the same hosts file, but this time redirect its output into a new file called ‘new_hosts’, and store it under the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory.

9) Copy the ‘file1.txt’ file from the ‘vars/systems/logs’ directory to the ‘vars/os’ directory and rename it to ‘new_file1.txt’ during the copy.

10) Inside the logs directory, create two empty files named ‘sshd_config’ and ‘httpd.conf’.

11) Create a new file named 'new_file.txt' in the ‘vars/systems’ directory with the content i.e. "I am enjoying DeveOps sessions and lab work". 

12) Attempt to delete the ‘vars/os/configs’ directory using the ‘rmdir command’. Were you successful? If not, why do you think it failed?

13) Use the tail command to display the the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd file and append the output (without overwriting existing content) to a file named 'passwd_output.txt' located in the vars/systems directory. 

14) Use head to show the first 5 lines of /etc/group overwriting existing content of a file named 'group_output.txt' located in the vars/systems directory..

15) Use the file command on /etc/passwd and /bin/ls. What does it tell you store in a file 'output_file' in ‘vars/systems/logs’.
