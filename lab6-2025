Important Note:
Please read carefully before using chown with sudo:
Your current working directory (PWD) must be your home directory.
As a regular user, you do not have permission to change file ownership on your own.
However, we've granted you limited sudo access to use chown, but only within your own home directory.
Usage Syntax:
sudo chown <new-owner> /home/<your-username>/<file-or-directory>
Note: using absolute path is mandatory, otherwise it will fail.

1. Create a file named “my_file.txt”. Check the owner and group of the file — both should be your username.

2. Change only the user ownership of “my_file.txt” from your username to “new-user”. Verify the change.

3. Now change the group of “my_file.txt” from your username to “students”. (Note: Use only the chown command for this step.)

4. Confirm that the group of “my_file.txt” has been successfully changed.

5. Create a new file named “new_file.txt”. Ensure that your username is set as both the owner and the group of this file.

6. Change both the owner and group of “new_file.txt” simultaneously: the owner should be “new-user” and the group should be “students”. Make sure this change is successful.

7. Create a file named “my_fun.txt” containing the text: "Changing ownership is really fun". Make sure your username is set as both the owner and group.

8. Change the group of “my_fun.txt” to “students”. (Note: Do not use the chown command for this step.)

9. Create two files named “test_file1” and “test_file2” in your home directory.

10. Change the ownership of both files (“test_file1” and “test_file2”) so that “new-user” is the owner and “admins” is the group. (Complete this task using a single command.)

11. Create a directory named “test_dir1” and use a long listing to verify that you are the owner and group of the directory.

12. Change both the owner and group of “test_dir1”: set the owner to “test-user” and the group to “admins”. (Ensure that both changes are done simultaneously.)

13. 13.	Create a directory named “my_new_dir”, and inside it create files “new_file1”, “new_file2”, and directories “new_dir1” and “new_dir2”. Then, change the owner to “test-user” and group to “admins” for “my_new_dir” directory, along with all its contents, recursively in a single command.
