1. Open your terminal and review processes in your system. Let’s try different command to display the list of all currently running processes on the system.
    
    a. Use the “ps” command to list the current processes running in your session.
    
    b. Use the “ps –ef” command to list all processes running on the system.
    
    c. Use the “ps aux” command to list all processes running on the system.
       Note: Both commands are listing all process but differ is detail about    processes.
    
    d. Use “pstree” command to list all processes running in your system in hierarchy, don’t overthink about it. Cool!

2. While you are in your home directory. Execute following commands 
   “vim file1_bg.vim &” 
   “vim file2_bg.vim &”
   Are you inside files. No, you should not be. Exactly! you got it “&” (ampersand) sign sent these processes in background.

3. Show only processes belonging to your current user.

4. Grep “vim” process from all the processes running in your system. If exists, then execute kill process by name. (Hint: use pkill command)

5. Display the top 10 processes consuming the most CPU.

6. Display the top 10 processes consuming the most memory.

7. Start the sleep 3000, sleep 20000, and sleep 30000 command in the background and verify that it is running.

8. List all background jobs running in your shell. (Hint use “jobs” command)

9. Kill the sleep 3000 process using its PID.

10. Check the priority (niceness value) of your current shell process.

11. Use kill -l to display all available kill signals.

12. Kill the process sleep 20000 using the SIGTERM signal.

13.	Kill the process sleep 30000 using the SIGKILL signal.

14. Display the total number of processes currently running on your machine.
