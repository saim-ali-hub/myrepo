1. Create the following nested directory structure in your home directory:
    •	projects/devtools/logs
    •	projects/system/settings

2. Inside the ‘devtools’ directory, create an empty file named ‘debug.log’ and 'new.log'.

3. Inside the ‘projects/devtools/logs’ directory, create a file named ‘status.txt’ containing the text:
   "System setup is in progress. Please wait..."

4. Copy the ‘/etc/fstab’ file into the ‘settings’ directory.

5. Move ‘new.log’ file from ‘devtools’ directory to the ‘settings’ directory.

6. Use the tail command to get the last 3 lines of ‘/etc/services’ file and redirect the output into a new file named ‘services.txt’ while store inside ‘settings’ directory.

7. Use the head command to get the first 3 lines of ‘/etc/resolv.conf’ file and redirect this output to the ‘projects/system’ directory and name it to “dns_report.txt”.

8. In the logs directory, create two empty configuration files ‘nginx.conf’ and ‘mysql.cnf’.

9. Copy the entire ‘settings’ directory, along with all its contents, in your 'home' direstory and rename it new_settings.

10. Copy 'service.txt' file from 'projects/settings' directory to 'projects/system' directory.
