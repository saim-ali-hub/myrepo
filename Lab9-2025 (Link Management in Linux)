Link Management in Linux 
=====================================================================================

==>	Symbolic (Soft) Link:
1. Add the text “I Love Linux Operating System” to a file named my_file.txt and save it in your home directory.

2. Create a symbolic (soft) link named my_link.txt that points to the file my_file.txt.

3. Verify that the symbolic link was successfully created by using the ls -l command.

4. Read the contents of my_link.txt and confirm it matches the target file.

5. Check the inode numbers of both my_link.txt and my_file.txt. What do you observe?

6. Create a directory named my_dir inside your home directory, and move my_file.txt into my_dir.

7. Verify the status of the symbolic link using the ls -l command.
   What happened? Oh no - the link is broken!

8. Move my_file.txt back from my_dir to your home directory.

9. Check the status of the symbolic link again using ls -l.
   Looks like the link is working again — success!

10. Attempt to change permissions on my_link.txt so that the user has read and write access, while the group and others have only read access.

11. Check the permissions of both my_link.txt and my_file.txt.
    Were the permissions updated on both files?

12. Remove the symbolic link using the unlink command.
    What happened to my_file.txt? Is it still intact?

13. Create a directory named new_dir in your home directory and then create two files inside it: file1.txt and file2.txt.

14. Create a symbolic link named new_link that points to the new_dir directory.

15. Verify that the symbolic link was created successfully using the ls -l command.
    If it worked, check the contents of both the link and the original directory.

16. Remove the symbolic link using the rm command.
    What happened to new_dir? Is it still intact?

==>	Hard Link

17. In your home directory, create a file named source_file.txt with the text “Welcome to Linoop”.

18. Create a hard link named hard_link.txt pointing to source_file.txt.

19. Verify that the hard link was created successfully using the ls -l command.

20. Read the contents of hard_link.txt.
   Do they match source_file.txt?

21. Check the inode numbers of both hard_link.txt and source_file.txt.
   Are they the same?

22. Create a directory named hard_link_dir in your home directory and move source_file.txt into that directory.

23. Check the status of hard_link.txt using the ls -l command.
   Is the hard link broken or still functioning?

24. Change the permissions of hard_link_dir so that the user has read and write access, and the group and others have only read access.

25. Check the permissions of both hard_link.txt and source_file.txt.
   Were permissions updated on both?

26. Delete the source_file.txt file.
    Now try viewing the contents of hard_link.txt. Is it still intact?

27. Attempt to create a hard link named new_hard_link that points to the directory my_new_dir. Were you successful? Why or why not?
